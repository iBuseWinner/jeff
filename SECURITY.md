# Security Policy

## Jeff Security Design

Initially, Jeff was conceived as a regular chatbot with extensible features. Now it is a platform in which it is easy to seize power over the data output window. If you have any security design ideas that could be implemented, please email `aclo.create@gmail.com` or [Telegram](https://t.me/markcda).

## Supported Versions

The first version of Jeff Qt to include security support is version 2.1.0. Previous versions do not have any significant limitations and/or ignore input without properly handling errors.

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 2.2.x   | :white_check_mark: |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you find a bug that could compromise user security, please report it to [email](mailto:aclo.create@gmail.com) or [Telegram](https://t.me/markcda) and we'll try to fix it it within one to two weeks. If you fixed the bug yourself, please submit a pull request and it will be reviewed in three days.

If you see a big security problem and want to suggest a mechanism for secure interaction with extensions or other external entities, write about it to [email](mailto:aclo.create@gmail.com). Your application can only be rejected if your idea is incredibly difficult to implement, or it does not provide other ways to implement some of the existing features.
